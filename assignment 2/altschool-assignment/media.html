        <h1 class="top">Hello everyone</h1>
        <p><i>
            My name is <strong>Abdulsamad</strong> and i am a student at Altschool Africa. I am currently enrolled in the <strong>Frontend Engineering</strong> program. This is my second assignment for the course, where I have created a simple HTML page that lists the schools and courses offered at Altschool Africa.
            The page includes a table that displays the schools and their respective courses, such as Frontend Engineering, Product Design, Data Analysis, and more. I hope you find this information helpful and informative.
        </p>

            I tried over the years to learn how to code, but I never really got the hang of it. I am determined to change that now, and I am excited to be a part of this program. I look forward to learning and growing as a developer.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am also looking forward to connecting with other students and professionals in the field, and I hope to contribute to the community in a meaningful way. Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy my assignment!
        </p>
           When I am not coding, I enjoy reading books, playing video games, and spending time with my family and friends. I believe that a well-rounded life is essential for personal and professional growth, and I strive to maintain a healthy balance between work and play.
        <p>
            I am also passionate about learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry. I believe that continuous learning is key to success in the tech world, and I am committed to improving my skills every day.
        <p>
            I firmly believe that coding is not just about writing lines of code, but about solving problems and creating solutions that can make a difference in people's lives. I am excited to be on this journey and to see where it takes me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction. I hope to connect with you soon and share more about my journey in the world of coding and technology.
